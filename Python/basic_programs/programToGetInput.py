# python program to get input from user 
name = input("Enter your name : ")
# print the same same from user input 
print ("Hi ", name )

# The return type of input method is string, so adding 2 numbers first we have to convert int to string

number1 = int(input("Enter first number my child : "))
number2 = int(input("Enter second number my child : "))
number3 = number1 + number2 
print("Sum of the two numbers you have entered is ", number3 )
